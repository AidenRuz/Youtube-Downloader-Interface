# Youtube-Downloader-Interface
A simply python command line interface for downloading audio and video from youtube using pytube.

# Usage
Provide a youtube link, choose whether you want to download audio or video, and program will allow you to select the quality of the stream you'd like to download.

Downlaod Location Options:
1. Current Working Directory
2. Python File Directory
3. Entered Manually

# Further Plans
Changes I would like to add to this program later on:
* Ability to handle youtube playlist links
* Convert downloaded file types
