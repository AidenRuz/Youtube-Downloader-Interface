# Youtube-Downloader-Interface
A simply python command line interface for downloading audio and video from youtube using pytube.

# Usage
After providing a youtube link, and choosing whether you want to download audio or video, the program will allow you to select the quality of the stream you'd like to download. The download folder will be created automatically during the first download and defaults to the folder the python file is in.

# Further Plans
Changes I would like to add to this program later on:
* Make the UI cleaner
* Ability to handle youtube playlist links
* Ability to change the download directory
